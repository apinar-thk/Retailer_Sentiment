Python code is used to scrape customer reviews from platforms like Trustpilot and uses sentiment analysis tools, including the VADER lexicon and TextBlob, to extract valuable insights. The VADER lexicon assigns sentiment scores to words, ranging from -1 for very negative to 1 for very positive, while ignoring neutral words and common stopwords like "the," "as," "at," and "of." Reviews are analyzed to identify the 50 most frequent words for each retailer, focusing on terms related to performance areas such as customer relations, pricing, sales, after-sales support, and quality of services.
